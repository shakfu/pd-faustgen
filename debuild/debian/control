Description:  Faust external for Pd
 The faustgen2~ object is a Faust external for Pd a.k.a. Pure Data, Miller
 Puckette's interactive multimedia programming environment. Yann Orlarey's
 Faust is a functional programming language developed by Grame, which is
 tailored for real-time signal processing and synthesis.
 .
 faustgen2~ is based on Pierre Guillot's faustgen~ which in turn was inspired
 by Grame's faustgen~ object for Max/MSP. Like faustgen~, faustgen2~ uses
 Faust's LLVM-based just-in-time (JIT) compiler to load, compile and play
 Faust programs on the fly. faustgen2~ is an extensive update which offers
 plenty of new functionality such as MIDI, polyphony, Scala tunings, OSC,
 and Pd GUI support, as well as a Pd loader extension for Faust.
